Little red riding hood

There was once a girl who wanted to give her sick grandmother some cookies as she ws old and sick, so the little girl dressed up and baked somecookies as she wanted to go to her grandm as quick as possible. 
Once she baked her cake she thought that she should cross the woods all by herself and suprise her grandmother with the cookies, but little did she know that all the cookies would make the big bad wolf attack her.
